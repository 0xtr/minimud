# minimud
A basic MUD-style server that allows connections via telnet. Fun to work on for learning, but nothing serious.

You can:

-create, edit, name, describe and delete rooms while connected

-add new commands through a text file that's parsed and stored at startup

-communicate with other players online

-return to the origin room, or save waypoints and return to them

-save your character and return to it at a later time
