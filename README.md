# minimud
A basic MUD-style server that allows connections via telnet. Fun to work on for learning, but nothing serious.

You can:

-create, edit, name, describe and delete rooms while connected

-communicate with other people online

-switch from the core world into your own, where you can build at will

-save your character and return to it at a later time
